## crypto/gpt-encrypt

**Category: crypto** 

## Description

I needed a block cipher to encrypt my flag, but I don't trust AES, so I asked ChatGPT to write one for me.
Note: the file gpt.py is almost directly copied from ChatGPT output, with some minor modifications to make it a valid python script.
